TicketAct
=========

TicketAct provides ticket management to boost your projects!

What is a *ticket*? Anything you want: an user story in an agile software cycle, a bug report coming from your users, or simply an item in a to-do list. A ticket is a basic representation of something meaningful to you that fits your business.

You can organize your tickets in boards, associate them with your project's components, track statistics, and a lot more. It helps you share the project vision in real time and improve the communication inside your team.
